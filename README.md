*Hello* :raising_hand:

*I'm Aanchal Mishra, a pre-final year student at SNDTWU, Mumbai pursuing B.Tech. Communities have a special place in my heart! I deliver tech talks, co-organize community events, network with like-minded people and volunteer active community events, technical workshops, study jams to encourage tech enthusiasts, especially Women in Technology.*
*Studying electronics and being a good programmer, who even teaches programming has taught me to be multitasking, as knowing a bit of hardware and a bit of software is extremely useful and gives me confidence to handle complex things smoothly.*


I'm passionate about
